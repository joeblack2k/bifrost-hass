## Comparison with diyHue

You might already be familiar with [diyHue](https://github.com/diyhue/diyHue),
an existing project that aims to emulate a Philips Hue Bridge.

diyHue is a well-established project, that integrates with countless
servers/services/light systems, and emulates many Hue Bridge features.

However, I have been frustrated with diyHue's MQTT integration, and its fairly
poor performance when operating more than a handful of lights at a time. Since
diyHue always sends individual messages to each light in a group, large rooms
can get quite slow (multiple seconds for every adjustment, no matter how minor).

Currently, diyHue does not support Zigbee groups (or MQTT groups) at all,
whereas Bifrost is (originally) written specifically to present Zigbee2MQTT
groups as Hue Bridge "rooms". For zigbee/mqtt use cases, this massively
increases performance and reliability.

Another thing about diyHue that frustrates me to no end, is the lack of
(working) support for push notifications. If you use the Hue App to control a
diyHue bridge, you will notice that it does not react to any changes from other
phones, home automation, etc. Also, the reported light states (on/off, color,
temperature, etc) are sometimes just wrong.

Overall, diyHue can do an impressive number of things, but it seems to have some
pretty rough edges.

Just to clarify, I've enjoyed using diyHue, and I wish them all the best. It's
also very useful, both as a home automation service, and a reverse engineering
resource.

However, if you're also using one or more Zigbee2MQTT servers to control Zigbee
devices, feel free to give Bifrost a try. It might be a better fit for your use
case.

In any case, feedback always welcome.

[^1]: Light state synchronization (i.e. consistency between hue emulator, hue
    app and reality) seems to be, unfortunately, somewhat brittle in diyHue. See
