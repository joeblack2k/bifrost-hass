# Bifrost Bridge

Bifrost enables you to emulate a Philips Hue Bridge to control lights, groups
and scenes from [Zigbee2Mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) or [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/).

If you are already familiar with [DiyHue](https://github.com/diyhue/diyHue), you
might like to read the [comparison with DiyHue](doc/comparison-with-diyhue.md).

## Installation guide

There are currently three ways you can install Bifrost:

1.  [Install manually](#manual) from source (recommended)
2.  [Install it via Docker](#docker) for container-based deployment.
3.  Install as Home Assistant Add-on. Please see the
    [bifrost-hassio](https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost-hassio) project for
    more information.

### Manual

To install Bifrost from source, you will need the following:

1.  The rust language toolchain (https://rustup.rs/)
2.  At least one Zigbee2MQTT server or WLED instance to connect to
3.  The MAC address of the network interface you want to run the server on
4.  `build-essential` package for compiling the source code (on Debian/Ubuntu systems)

First, install a few necessary build dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl3 libssl-dev
```

When you have these things available, install bifrost:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/chrivers/bifrost.git
```

After Cargo has finished downloading, compiling, and installing Bifrost, you
should have the "bifrost" command available to you.

The last step is to create a configuration for bifrost, `config.yaml`.

Here's a minimal example:

```yaml
bridge:
  name: Bifrost
  mac: 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ipaddress: 10.12.0.20
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.12.0.1
  timezone: Europe/Copenhagen

z2m:
  server1:
    url: ws://10.0.0.100:8080
```

Please adjust this as needed. Particularly, make **sure** the "mac:" field
matches a mac address on the network interface you want to serve requests from.

Make sure to read the [configuration reference](doc/config-reference.md) to
learn how to adjust the configuration file.

This mac address if used to generate a self-signed certificate, so the Hue App
will recognize this as a "real" Hue Bridge. If the mac address is incorrect,
this will not work. [How to find your mac address](doc/how-to-find-mac-linux.md).

Now you can start Bifrost. Simple start the "bifrost" command from the same
directory where you put the `config.yaml`:

```sh
bifrost
```

At this point, the server should start: (log timestamps omitted for clarity)

```

The log output shows Bifrost talking with zigbee2mqtt, and finding some lights to control (office\_{1,2,3}).

At this point, you're running a Bifrost bridge.

The Philips Hue app should be able to find it on your network!

### Docker

#### Docker Installation

To install Bifrost with Docker, you will need the following:

1.  At least one Zigbee2MQTT server or WLED instance to connect to
2.  The MAC address of the network interface you want to run the server on
3.  A running [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) instance
    with [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
4.  Have `git` installed to clone this repository
